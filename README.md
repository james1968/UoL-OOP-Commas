1. Add a separator after each string character
   Separating by commas

Task: Implement a method which given a String inserts commas after each character.
Challenge
Write a method separate that, given a String, returns the String derived from the 
given one by inserting a comma character (‘,’) between each pair of consecutive 
characters.
If the given String has length 0 or 1, then the method should return the given 
String, or one that is textually equivalent.
For example, separate( “Hello” ) should return the String “H,e,l,l,o”.
